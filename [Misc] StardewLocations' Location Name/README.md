# StardewLocations' Location name.
Version: 1.4

I make this so the mod have references for location names. 
Currently support: 
* Vanilla before 1.5.0 update. //I haven't gotten to the new location yet.
* Stardew Valley Expanded. //WIP, Partially supported, May have some missing names.

#Translation
If you wanted to add location names yourself or wanted to translate it yourself. Just send a pull request.
I will commit any change.

Please adhere the formatting I made. Add comments for different overworld location, the inside of the building must be below it.
